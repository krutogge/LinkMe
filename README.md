# LinkMe
Tired of the modern recruiting? Cant stand corporate language? let the recruiters come to you by automatic networking on LinkedIn. Chill around and let them come to you with an offer instead of being the kneedog to the corporate management.

LinkMe is the first version of automating linkedin to increase the amount of visitors to your profile. 
Setup:
- type in your login to linkedin
- add your browser directory (it will show linkedin that you have history from other sites, hidden in the crowd)
- install any add-ons in your enviroment

Start:
1. search for a word, LinkMe will create a list with people whom you have a distant connection to and that word
2. it will visit their profiles, and try to act human by randomized logic movements before checking out the next profile

The endresult looks ruffly like this. Out of 100 people, 10 people will see your profile and 1-2 people will try to make contact.
